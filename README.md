# Data-Industry-Survey-Visualizations

I have published it in my Powerbi service, but it seems that I can not share it without paying, so I download the pdf version of my dash board. But PDF version can not use powerbi grouping function to see the data.

#Insights after the Visualization
1. In most of the country, the average salary working as a Data Scientist is the highest except Canada and UK. However, data scientist seems to have a low market demand, since most of the survey takers are data analytics(381) but data scientist only have 25.

2. The most popular language in data industry is Python, then R, nearly 4 times gap between them. SQL here is belonging to other range, it is the third category. The rest language is not frequently used in data industry.
3. America has the biggest market for data workers, a majority of them works in America. It outweighs other country a lot
4. Female seems to have advantages in the data industry, both the salary and the workers outweighs the male workers.
5. People worked as data scientist seems to have the best satisfaction in their job, while data architect and student/looking seems to be least happy with their job.
